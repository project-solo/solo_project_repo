# EMPLOYEES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# Our target from this solo project is to create a CRUD application which manages employees of an organization. HR User can perform the following operations:

1- List all the Employees

2- Create new Employee

3- Update salary of an existing Employee

4- Delete Existing Employee


#  Run the app
- [ ] Run `npm install` inside the `employee-db` directory to install dependencies.
- [ ] Ensure that the MongoDB process is running on your computer (`mongod`).
- [ ] Create the database by running `npm run db:setup`. Make sure you check if the database was successfully seeded using MongoDBCompass or any tool of your choice. It should contain the 10 documents in the `data.json` file
- [ ] Serve your application from the provided ExpressJS web server.
  - start your application with two commands, `npm run react-dev` and `npm start`, in two separate terminal tabs. For more information about Webpack, take a look at [the Webpack Docs](https://webpack.github.io/docs/).
